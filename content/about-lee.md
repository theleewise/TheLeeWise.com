Lee brings a creative element to his front-end work. His broad portfolio developing software includes industries like healthcare, government, e-commerce and more. He is a graphic design graduate from Sam Houston State University. Lee believes the best way to improve your craft is to challenge yourself. He does this in his daily work by finding more efficient ways to approach problems.

With clients, Lee understands the importance of open communication. You are more likely to get a personal phone call than an email message to discuss your project. Lee likes to add a human element to building client relationships.

Did we mention Lee is also a part-time magician? No, really. This guy has more than coding tricks up his sleeve!
